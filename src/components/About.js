        <p>My name is Andreas Ypper and I am a junior software developer. Currently working as a backend developer and mainly writing .NET code.
          My journey into this profession has not been straight forward. Several years back I studied data science, but after my master thesis
          me and my girlfriend moved from Karlstad to GÃ¶teborg.

          There I started to work as a postman and later found a really cool company called Skyltmax.
          I worked there for almost 5 and a half year as a production leader for the engraving department. I made sure that the engraving machines worked, that our section held
          the deadlines and also helped develop the production. Here I started to see some improvements that could be made quite easily with some code. So I started to write some
          scripts, building a website and started more and more looking for stuff that could be fixed with code.

          During one summer vacation a friend of mine tipped me about a job at Afry as a software developer that I applied for and got. So now I work full time as a developer.
          Super stoked about that!

          Besides writing code and solving problems I love to spend time with my family. Fiance Emelie and my two kids Alfred and Sally.
          I also like to ride my gravel bike or go to the local skate park and ride my skateboard.

          This site will contain my hobby projects. Maybe a blog or some sort of training diary. Time will tell!
